The J! Scorer is a web app for prospective _Jeopardy!_ contestants to track
their training progress.

It is up and running on the web at <https://j-scorer.com>. User documentation
can be found [there][1], via the Help link.

For developers, this is a pretty-standard Rails 4 app. If you don't know what
to do with that, any decent tutorial should get you started. If you need any
further help, drop me a line at <steve@j-scorer.com>.
